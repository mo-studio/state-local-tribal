Hello! Welcome to the MO State, Local, and Tribal team's Github. 

## Our team
We're a scrappy, experienced team founded by former public servants with policy, human-centered design, and software engineering expertise. We help states rapidly meet the moment on urgent "can't fail" implementation priorities while saving costs, reducing administrative burden, and partnering side by side with state staff to build in-house state capacity as we go. 

Founding team members include alumni from 18F, U.S. Digital Service, CFPB, and USDA.
