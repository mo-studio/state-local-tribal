# H.R.1 Open Source Implementation Toolkit (HR1-OSIT)

## What is this?
The H.R.1 Open Source Implementation Toolkit (HR1-OSIT) is a set of guides, templates, and tools created for state staff and public interest technologists who are responsible for implementing the requirements of the law which are free for anyone to download, use, fork, remix and distribute under a creative commons XYZ license.

The toolkit was created by a group of public interest technologists who are concerned about the potential harms of changes required by H.R.1 on members of the public as well as the state staff and frontline workers responsible for implementing required changes – given the administrative burdens incurred and eligible people disenrolled after previous iterations of similar policies were implemented.

## Who was it created for?
* State implementers who are responsible for implementing H.R.1 changes, including non-profit partners and vendor teams.
* State policy leads who want to dig into how policy options could be implemented from a harm-reduction lens.
* Public interests technologists, academics, and non profit organizations who care about reducing harms of H.R.1.

## Our principles
* **State-centered.** Our aim with this guide is to leave states stronger, more confident, and more capable of implementing H.R.1 changes in a way that minimizes administrative burden, saves costs, and keeps eligible people enrolled than before.
* **Free to download, use, remix, modify, and distribute.** 
* **Tech and vendor agnostic.** Regardless of the technology stacks (be they COBOL, AWS, ServiceNow, etc) states are using to determine eligibility for and distribute state public benefits, these tools will work for you. They were created from the perspective of being useful regardless of the specific vendor or technology stack you’re working with.
* **No “one size fits all” solutions.** We recognize the unique contexts and challenges inherent to each state. Rather than provide one-size fits all solutions, we aim to provide optionality wherever possible for states to make informed decisions based on their particular needs.

## How can I get involved? Where can I get in touch?
Feel free to send us a note at sandlot@themostudio.com. We’re also spinning up a Slack instance for those interested in collaborating on H.R.1 implementation from a harm-reduction lens in real-time.

Additionally, if you’ve got thoughts on how this toolkit could be improved, feel free to send us a note at the email above or create an issue. We’d be glad to hear from you and welcome ideas, collaborations, remixes, and suggested edits.
